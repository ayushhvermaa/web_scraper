By bringing together powerful, relevant ideas and passionate, talented people, ACS makes a difference in the constitutional, legal and public policy debates that shape our democracy.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Shaping Debate</strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>The American Constitution Society brings together many of the country&rsquo;s best legal minds to articulate a progressive vision of our Constitution and laws. Through its public programs (over 1,100 debates, conferences and press briefings across America each year), publications, and active on-line presence, ACS generates &ldquo;intellectual capital&rdquo; for ready use by progressive allies and shapes debates on key legal and public policy issues.</p>\\r\\n<p>The American Constitution Society is also debunking conservative buzzwords such as &ldquo;originalism&rdquo; and &ldquo;strict construction&rdquo; that use neutral-sounding language but all too often lead to conservative policy outcomes. Using both traditional and new media to communicate with policymakers, judges, lawyers and the public at large, ACS presents a compelling vision of core constitutional values such as genuine equality, liberty, justice and the rule of law.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Building Networks</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;One of the American Constitution Society&rsquo;s principal missions is nurturing the next generation of progressive lawyers, judges, policy experts, legislators and academics.</p>\\r\\n<p>The engine that drives the organization&rsquo;s work is its rapidly growing nationwide network: nearly 200 student chapters in law schools in 47 states, 34 lawyer chapters in large and small cities in every part of the country, and over 16,000 paying members and thousands of other supporters. ACS chapters offer platforms for debate and discussion about both enduring principles and the issues of the day, as well as provide opportunities for networking, mentoring and organizing around matters of both local and national significance.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Making a Difference</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;The strength of ACS&rsquo;s ideas and the scope of its nationwide network enable it to make a difference in legal and public policy debates and ensure that law is a force to improve the lives of all people. Recent examples of ACS initiatives and programs having an impact include an Issue Brief on the constitutionality of the individual mandate in the health care reform legislation, cited during the Senate floor debate and entered into the Congressional Record; Senator Al Franken&rsquo;s 2010 ACS National Convention speech in which he stated that &ldquo;Originalism isn&rsquo;t a pillar of our constitutional history; it&rsquo;s a talking point;&rdquo; and a concerted effort by ACS members to promote up-or-down votes on judicial nominations by engaging key decision makers.</p>', 'Summary': 'The American Constitution Society believes that law should be a force to improve the lives of all people.

The Center&rsquo;s first big milestone came when the Chancellor announced Berkeley would create a confidential advocate position, a crucial resource for survivors seeking services, as well as for those seeking to understand or pursue a university disciplinary process.</p>\\r\\n<p>Later in 2014, the first Bear Pact program launched, educating all incoming first-year and transfer undergraduate students about sexual violence prevention, with content designed and delivered by the University Health Services Health Promotion team. Following this, in the fall, the first advocate &ndash; who would go on to become the Center&rsquo;s first director &ndash; was hired: Mari Knuth-Bouracee.</p>\\r\\n<p>The Center saw an immediate and overwhelming demand for services, which led to the ASUC and GA passing the Wellness Initiative Fee Referendum &ndash; a commitment of student fees funding several initiatives, including a new advocate position for the Center. This Referendum solidified the University&rsquo;s commitment to expanding the Center&rsquo;s resources for all who need them, and helped lead to rapid growth: two advocates were hired, sexual violence prevention education was included for the first time in graduate student education, and an Assistant Director for Prevention joined the Center&rsquo;s team. With the rapid expansion and demand for services, the Center quickly grew out of its one-room office and into a new space that included two counseling rooms for client meetings, crucial for confidentiality, in early 2016.</p>\\r\\n<p>In mid-2016, the Center added an Assistant Director for Survivor Support, a Program Analyst, and two Prevention Program Managers. The need for the Center was clear &ndash; and in July, the US Office on Women&rsquo;s Health awarded the University a grant, with the Center as the lead department, to continue to expand this work.</p>\\r\\n<p>The Center then launched a peer education program, which began with the hiring of 11 peer educators, as well as a Care Line, the 24/7 crisis line for the University. Continuing its focus on graduate student sexual violence prevention, the Center hired its first Program Manager for Graduate Prevention. The Center also launched The Well, a Black healing space co-led by a Center advocate.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since its launch, the Center has continued to deepen its focus on both survivor support and prevention. By late 2017, videos created by the Center highlighting these practices had been shown to over 15,000 students, faculty and staff (and continue to be shown each year); the Center launched Yoga As Healing groups; and the Center received further recognition when the Office on Violence Against Women awarded the University a grant, with the Center as the lead department.

On a daily basis, our brothers live up to these ideals, as set forth by fourteen young Latino men decades ago.&nbsp;<br /><br />Since our founding, Lambda Theta Phi has established chapters in every region of the country at both the undergraduate and professional levels. Our brotherhood continues to provide the necessary skills and resources for the advancement and empowerment of our people and for the betterment of this nation.&nbsp;<br /><br />The University of California, Berkeley was home to the newest chapter of Lambda Theta Phi, Latin Fraternity, Inc. in the Spring semester of 2004. Ten undergraduate students came together with the idea of introducing a positive image of a Latino fraternity to the UC Berkeley campus. They wanted to embrace and take part in the unity, brotherhood, pride and respect for all cultures that Lambda Theta Phi offered.<br /><br />On May 9, 2004, Luis Sanchez, Renato Manay, Renzo Manay, Arquimides Pacheco, and Rafael Hernandez created a historical landmark and established the first Latino Greek Letter Fraternity officially recognized by the National Interfraternal Council (NIC) on the UC Berkeley campus.<br /><br />Now, since its establishment and through its further development and growth, Lambda Theta Phi in UC Berkeley has continued to carry through its ideals of a service/social fraternity by giving back to the community while engaging in social activities that would allow further bondages among our members and with other organizations. Such include our participation in the Annual AIDS Walk, our service in low-income Oakland Elementary schools, and advocacy of immigrant rights to day laborers within the county of Alameda. Apart from these community service events, this chapter has sought to create strong ties and mutual respect with other Latin and non-Latin organizations through social activities and collaborative efforts.<br /><br />Lastly, the main goal of Lambda Theta Phi in UC Berkeley is to pursue the educational success of our fraternity brothers. At the national level, from New Jersey to California, many go on to become doctors, lawyers, engineers, among other professionals.</span></p>', 'Summary': 'The FIRST and The LARGEST at the #1 Public Institution in the NATION.

Letterman and Charles P.T. Moore, in the college town of Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, were nursing and watching their stricken friends during an epidemic of typhoid fever.

It flourished, and gradually extended to other colleges and universities throughout the country. Pragmatic idealists, the founders of Phi Kappa Psi sought a new fraternity &ndash; a fraternity that should complement the work of the university by cultivating those humanities without which the educated man fails of his greatest usefulness, founded upon the great joy of serving others.</p>\\r\\n<p>The centennial anniversary Phi Kappa Psi was at the old home of the Widow Letterman in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, on February 19, 1952. Over 100 members of the Fraternity gathered together for this occasion including three of the grandsons of the Founders. A bronze tablet commemorating the centennial was moved to the Pennsylvania Alpha chapter house. In the Fraternity&rsquo;s first 100 years, Phi Kappa Psi had grown to 56 chapters, 40 Alumni Associations and 40,000 initiates. Phi Kappa Psi today has ninety-seven chapters in thirty-four states and the District of Columbia with 4,778 active student members. There have been nearly 113,000 men initiated. Unlike most national fraternities, the constitution of Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity vests control over its affairs in the student members through the election of six of the ten members of the Executive Council and voting control at the GAC. The Endowment Fund of Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity is a foundation that provides financial support for education programs of the Fraternity and financial support through scholarships and grants to its members.

She asked a few Southeast Asian UC Berkeley students in her class and some she knew to help get involved with the conference. Their role was to head up the youth portion of the co<span class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_text_exposed_show\">nference. Using data information collected the conference Professor Um along with the UC Berkeley students developed the booklet that SASC has called A Dream Denied about Southeast Asians and their struggle to gain access to higher education.</span></p>\\r\\n<p><span class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_text_exposed_show\"><br />After the conference, the youth summit organizers, consisting of members from the Laotian, Hmong, Cambodian, and Vietnamese student groups felt connected and saw a need for a space/coalition to address issues across the community. They recognized that there were distinct groups that already existed to promote cultural awareness and knew that that was not one of their primary goals. They were also aware that they wanted the group to be more than just a student organization, but a coalition between the Cambodian, Vietnamese, and Laotian students coming together on common issues to strengthen the community as a whole, hence the name Southeast Asian Student Coalition. The name was created by the students as they sat at Sproul Fountain. Their goals at the time included greater promotion of higher education, community building between the different groups, outreaching to the larger community.<br /><br />At the time they believed that there was a niche that needed to be filled &ndash; an organization that would work with the different cultural groups as well as the recruitment and retention center to address the SEA community in particular. Their goal was to both build coalition as well as empowerment, and to step beyond the needs at Berkeley to incorporate the communities we came from. They went around the East Bay community asking and understanding what it is exactly that they can do. After all of that, in 2002 SASC Summer Institute was born. They wanted something where they can effectively outreach, teach, and learn to/from young people.<br /><br />Since then SASC has grown into a larger community and has expanded its reaches into the community. SASC&rsquo;s current programs include SEA Grad, SEAMentorship, SEA Prison Outreach Project, and Anthology.<br /><br />In 2005, a group of SASC folks had multiple meetings about the rebuilding of SASC, due to issues of sustainability and finding leaders in the community. From these meetings SASCommunity, a non-hierarchical committee, was created. SASComm strives to create a community of committees hoping to explore SASC&rsquo;s mission statement in different and multiple dimensions. The Round-Table structure for SASCommunity is set up to create a cohesive unit and non-hierarchical organizing system.</span></p>', 'Summary': '\"To unite Southeast Asian communities, particularly those bounded by the historical context of the Viet Nam War, and to address the social injustices, economic inequalities and political under-representation that they face.\"', 'CategoryIds': ['2694', '7850', '7851', '9413', '9415', '10377', '14365', '17399', '17401'], 'CategoryNames': ['z ASUC Student Initiated Service Groups', 'Undergraduate Organizations', 'Cultural & Identity/Cultural & Ethnic', 'Esh 2018-2019 ABSA Allocations', 'ABSA-Allocated Hearst Storage ', 'ABSA-Allocated Hearst Storage 2018-2019', 'ABSA- Allocated ESH Space', 'ABSA - NP;NP Orgs', 'ASUC No Budget, No Pay Qualified Organizations'], 'Status': 'Active', 'Visibility': 'Public'}, {'@search.score': 1.0, 'Id': '160137', 'InstitutionId': 1660, 'ParentOrganizationId': 45852, 'BranchId': 45852, 'Name': 'Space Enterprise at Berkeley ', 'ShortName': 'SEB', 'WebsiteKey': 'seberkeley', 'ProfilePicture': 'bacd4f72-4f09-43fc-8540-ec71c5ab8c6511c747cc-d1fe-4acd-b96c-20f105cae0dc.PNG', 'Description': '<p class=\"\">Co-founded in October 2016, Space Enterprise at Berkeley (SEB) is a student run liquid-fuel rocket team dedicated to achieving spaceflight and developing rocket technologies at University of California, Berkeley.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\"\">SEB is one of the most ambitious college rocket teams in the world, with the goal of achieving spaceflight with a liquid-fueled rocket.

SFHBC at Berkeley provided trained bilingual students as Asian language interpreters for two monthly UCSF hepatitis B student-run clinics, which we continue to volunteer at.</p>\\r\\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>Dedicated to helping stop the spread of Hepatitis B, SFHBC partnered with organizations such as the San Francisco Hepatitis B Free Campaign and helped at various screening, vaccination, and education events. Four hundred million people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B infection, which tragically can lead to liver cancer early in adult life. It is the 10th leading etiologic cause of death in the world. Fortunately, the spread of the hepatitis B virus is preventable with a simple, safe, and effective vaccine.</p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>Due to an increase in demand for interpretation services, we have been expanding to provide interpretation and volunteering services for a broader range of issues beyond hepatitis B. In August 2010, SFHBC at Berkeley was renamed the Volunteer Health Interpreters Organization (VHIO) to reflect its expanded scope of language capacities and its service base across the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We provide trained volunteer interpreters in several languages - Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Tagalog, and Vietnamese - from UC Berkeley to healthcare organizations and facilities for underserved LEP communities.

ACS works for positive change by shaping debate on vitally important legal and constitutional issues through development and promotion of high-impact ideas to opinion leaders and the media; by building networks of lawyers, law students, judges and policymakers dedicated to those ideas; and by countering the activist conservative legal movement that has sought to erode our enduring constitutional values. By bringing together powerful, relevant ideas and passionate, talented people, ACS makes a difference in the constitutional, legal and public policy debates that shape our democracy.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Shaping Debate</strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>The American Constitution Society brings together many of the country&rsquo;s best legal minds to articulate a progressive vision of our Constitution and laws. Through its public programs (over 1,100 debates, conferences and press briefings across America each year), publications, and active on-line presence, ACS generates &ldquo;intellectual capital&rdquo; for ready use by progressive allies and shapes debates on key legal and public policy issues.</p>\\r\\n<p>The American Constitution Society is also debunking conservative buzzwords such as &ldquo;originalism&rdquo; and &ldquo;strict construction&rdquo; that use neutral-sounding language but all too often lead to conservative policy outcomes. Using both traditional and new media to communicate with policymakers, judges, lawyers and the public at large, ACS presents a compelling vision of core constitutional values such as genuine equality, liberty, justice and the rule of law.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Building Networks</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;One of the American Constitution Society&rsquo;s principal missions is nurturing the next generation of progressive lawyers, judges, policy experts, legislators and academics.</p>\\r\\n<p>The engine that drives the organization&rsquo;s work is its rapidly growing nationwide network: nearly 200 student chapters in law schools in 47 states, 34 lawyer chapters in large and small cities in every part of the country, and over 16,000 paying members and thousands of other supporters. ACS chapters offer platforms for debate and discussion about both enduring principles and the issues of the day, as well as provide opportunities for networking, mentoring and organizing around matters of both local and national significance.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Making a Difference</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;The strength of ACS&rsquo;s ideas and the scope of its nationwide network enable it to make a difference in legal and public policy debates and ensure that law is a force to improve the lives of all people. Recent examples of ACS initiatives and programs having an impact include an Issue Brief on the constitutionality of the individual mandate in the health care reform legislation, cited during the Senate floor debate and entered into the Congressional Record; Senator Al Franken&rsquo;s 2010 ACS National Convention speech in which he stated that &ldquo;Originalism isn&rsquo;t a pillar of our constitutional history; it&rsquo;s a talking point;&rdquo; and a concerted effort by ACS members to promote up-or-down votes on judicial nominations by engaging key decision makers.</p>',\n",

The main objectives of the ANS Student Branch is consistent with those of the National ANS, which is to promote the advancement of science and engineering relating to the atomic nucleus and of allied sciences and arts.We are formed and managed by a group of students interested to contribute toward the development of nuclear science and technology at the University of California through activities in which student members and faculty may participate.Most of us are students in the Nuclear Engineering Department but we welcome students from all backgrounds to join us. The only requirements we ask for is a desire to learn and an open-mind for new technology.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 12px 0px 12px 0px;\">We organize events for the benefit of our own members as well as to promote understanding of nuclear technology on campus. The recent focus of this society has been to increase public awareness of the many benefits of nuclear technology and its place in our future. With the increasing threats of nuclear terrorism, our aim is to educate the public on the safety issues and responsibilities related to nuclear power generation as well as the peaceful use of nuclear materials in medical radiation as well as food processing industries.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 12px 0px 12px 0px;\">Our student section has sent many students to the ANS national conferences over the years. In 2002, UC Berkeley-ANS sponsored the National Student Conference for ANS and the conference was a tremendous success in bringing together students from all over the country to present information on latest technology in the field and to foster interaction between like-minded current and future scientists.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 12px 0px 12px 0px;\"><strong style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">Our Mission</strong></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 12px 0px 12px 0px;\">The American Nuclear Society serves its members in their efforts to develop and safely apply nuclear science and technology for public benefit through knowledge exchange, professional development, and enhanced public understanding.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 12px 0px 12px 0px;\">&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 12px 0px 12px 0px;\">To receive our periodic emails about upcoming events and opportunities, please subscribe to our mailing list at&nbsp;<a href=\"/actioncenter/organization/americannuclearsociety/tinyurl.com/ANS-MailingList\">tinyurl.com/ANS-MailingList</a> and check out our website at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ans.nuc.berkeley.edu\">https://ans.nuc.berkeley.edu</a></p>',\n",

On this campus&mdash;where 42% of students&nbsp;identified as Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) in 2008&mdash;there was not a single academic course devoted to the study of health in AAPI communities. The AAPI Health Research Group (AAPIHRG) was formed in 2008 to fill this void. The purpose of this&nbsp;group is to share our journey and findings in AAPI community health with other students and community professionals who may wish to join us or contribute to the work.</p>\\r\\n<p>Although the aggregate data for our community paints a picture of a healthy population, we know that good health is not enjoyed by all. Our community is not homogeneous. The diversity of the many ethnic groups that make up the AAPI community presents challenges in obtaining accurate data. Students who come from these diverse backgrounds can be an important conduit in raising our awareness of health problems that exist in these communities. This can foster a deeper understanding of health in the broader AAPI community.</p>\\r\\n<p>Besides the 4-unit Spring course (ASAMST 190 - \"Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Community Health: Foundational Theories &amp; Contemporary Issues\"), we are inviting you to take part in our next steps as we develop&nbsp;as a student organization. We are open <strong>to all students</strong> interested in community health and specifically the AAPI community. We hope that through&nbsp;this organization, we foster in students a desire to serve the community as well as provide opportunities for leadership development and networking.</p>\\r\\n<p>We invite your participation in AAPIHRG as a student or as a health professional sharing the following vision and mission:</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>VISION</strong></p>\\r\\n<p>A healthy community can only exist within a healthy society. We strive to improve the health of the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities through research and service within the community and through social activism in society.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>MISSION</strong></p>\\r\\n<p>The AAPI Health Research Group was formed in the spring of 2008.

    "   'desc': '<p><strong>ACS About Us</strong></p>\\r\\n<p>The American Constitution Society (ACS) believes that law should be a force to improve the lives of all people. ACS works for positive change by shaping debate on vitally important legal and constitutional issues through development and promotion of high-impact ideas to opinion leaders and the media; by building networks of lawyers, law students, judges and policymakers dedicated to those ideas; and by countering the activist conservative legal movement that has sought to erode our enduring constitutional values. By bringing together powerful, relevant ideas and passionate, talented people, ACS makes a difference in the constitutional, legal and public policy debates that shape our democracy.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Shaping Debate</strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>The American Constitution Society brings together many of the country&rsquo;s best legal minds to articulate a progressive vision of our Constitution and laws. Through its public programs (over 1,100 debates, conferences and press briefings across America each year), publications, and active on-line presence, ACS generates &ldquo;intellectual capital&rdquo; for ready use by progressive allies and shapes debates on key legal and public policy issues.</p>\\r\\n<p>The American Constitution Society is also debunking conservative buzzwords such as &ldquo;originalism&rdquo; and &ldquo;strict construction&rdquo; that use neutral-sounding language but all too often lead to conservative policy outcomes. Using both traditional and new media to communicate with policymakers, judges, lawyers and the public at large, ACS presents a compelling vision of core constitutional values such as genuine equality, liberty, justice and the rule of law.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Building Networks</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;One of the American Constitution Society&rsquo;s principal missions is nurturing the next generation of progressive lawyers, judges, policy experts, legislators and academics.</p>\\r\\n<p>The engine that drives the organization&rsquo;s work is its rapidly growing nationwide network: nearly 200 student chapters in law schools in 47 states, 34 lawyer chapters in large and small cities in every part of the country, and over 16,000 paying members and thousands of other supporters. ACS chapters offer platforms for debate and discussion about both enduring principles and the issues of the day, as well as provide opportunities for networking, mentoring and organizing around matters of both local and national significance.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Making a Difference</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;The strength of ACS&rsquo;s ideas and the scope of its nationwide network enable it to make a difference in legal and public policy debates and ensure that law is a force to improve the lives of all people. Recent examples of ACS initiatives and programs having an impact include an Issue Brief on the constitutionality of the individual mandate in the health care reform legislation, cited during the Senate floor debate and entered into the Congressional Record; Senator Al Franken&rsquo;s 2010 ACS National Convention speech in which he stated that &ldquo;Originalism isn&rsquo;t a pillar of our constitutional history; it&rsquo;s a talking point;&rdquo; and a concerted effort by ACS members to promote up-or-down votes on judicial nominations by engaging key decision makers.</p>',\n",

On this campus&mdash;where 42% of students&nbsp;identified as Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) in 2008&mdash;there was not a single academic course devoted to the study of health in AAPI communities. The AAPI Health Research Group (AAPIHRG) was formed in 2008 to fill this void. The purpose of this&nbsp;group is to share our journey and findings in AAPI community health with other students and community professionals who may wish to join us or contribute to the work.</p>\\r\\n<p>Although the aggregate data for our community paints a picture of a healthy population, we know that good health is not enjoyed by all. Our community is not homogeneous. The diversity of the many ethnic groups that make up the AAPI community presents challenges in obtaining accurate data. Students who come from these diverse backgrounds can be an important conduit in raising our awareness of health problems that exist in these communities. This can foster a deeper understanding of health in the broader AAPI community.</p>\\r\\n<p>Besides the 4-unit Spring course (ASAMST 190 - \"Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Community Health: Foundational Theories &amp; Contemporary Issues\"), we are inviting you to take part in our next steps as we develop&nbsp;as a student organization.

API Caucus was also formed to create a safe holding space for API folks to build community with each other and reflect about their experiences in and out of the MSW program. API Caucus also serves to empower and uplift the voices of self-identified Asian and/or Pacific Islander students within a program that lacks representation of this community. </span></p>',\n",

The California chapter was founded 1905, having the distinction of being one of the oldest operating chapters in the National organization.</p>\\r\\n<p>However, \"an organization is not necessarily good because it is old, but old because it is good.\" There are a lot of great fraternities out there, and only you can decide which one is right for you. Here are a few reasons why Acacia Fraternity should be on your short list.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_highlightg\"><strong>Acacia Emphasizes Academic Achievement</strong></p>\\r\\n<p>Academic achievement should be the first and foremost priority of all university students. It is also central to the mission of Acacia Fraternity, whose chapters stress academics above all else. Moreover, the Acacia Fraternity Foundation assists deserving Acacians with cash scholarships &mdash; over $250,000 in scholarships and educational grants were awarded by the foundation during the 2007-2008 academic year alone.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_highlightg\"><strong>Acacia Develops Leaders</strong></p>\\r\\n<p>Acacia Fraternity is dedicated to building leaders by providing a wealth of leadership opportunities for our members. From social issues to academic, business to philanthropy, the Acacians of today are the leaders of tomorrow.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.acacia.org/about_notables.php\">Click here to view a list of prominent Acacians</a>.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_highlightg\"><strong>Acacians Help Better the Communities in Which We Reside</strong></p>\\r\\n<p>Our motto is \"Human Service,\" and we take it very seriously. As member of Acacia Fraternity you will have ongoing opportunities, through structured community service programs, to make a difference in the lives of those in need.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_highlightg\"><strong>Acacians Value Fitness</strong></p>\\r\\n<p>Members of Acacia are encouraged to participate in intramural sports, a system in which athletes of all caliber find camaraderie and physical challenge. Whatever the sport, and whatever your skill level, as a member of Acacia you will always have a place on the team.</p>\\r\\n<p class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_highlightg\"><strong>Acacians Know How to Have Fun</strong></p>\\r\\n<p>Forget the \"Animal House\" stereotype of reckless partying and irresponsible behavior. Acacia\\'s policy is that each chapter maintains a fun yet responsible social policy that promotes responsible choices and the dignity of every individual as well as zero tolerance for illegal activities.</p>',\n",

ACS works for positive change by shaping debate on vitally important legal and constitutional issues through development and promotion of high-impact ideas to opinion leaders and the media; by building networks of lawyers, law students, judges and policymakers dedicated to those ideas; and by countering the activist conservative legal movement that has sought to erode our enduring constitutional values. By bringing together powerful, relevant ideas and passionate, talented people, ACS makes a difference in the constitutional, legal and public policy debates that shape our democracy.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Shaping Debate</strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>The American Constitution Society brings together many of the country&rsquo;s best legal minds to articulate a progressive vision of our Constitution and laws. Through its public programs (over 1,100 debates, conferences and press briefings across America each year), publications, and active on-line presence, ACS generates &ldquo;intellectual capital&rdquo; for ready use by progressive allies and shapes debates on key legal and public policy issues.</p>\\r\\n<p>The American Constitution Society is also debunking conservative buzzwords such as &ldquo;originalism&rdquo; and &ldquo;strict construction&rdquo; that use neutral-sounding language but all too often lead to conservative policy outcomes. Using both traditional and new media to communicate with policymakers, judges, lawyers and the public at large, ACS presents a compelling vision of core constitutional values such as genuine equality, liberty, justice and the rule of law.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Building Networks</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;One of the American Constitution Society&rsquo;s principal missions is nurturing the next generation of progressive lawyers, judges, policy experts, legislators and academics.</p>\\r\\n<p>The engine that drives the organization&rsquo;s work is its rapidly growing nationwide network: nearly 200 student chapters in law schools in 47 states, 34 lawyer chapters in large and small cities in every part of the country, and over 16,000 paying members and thousands of other supporters. ACS chapters offer platforms for debate and discussion about both enduring principles and the issues of the day, as well as provide opportunities for networking, mentoring and organizing around matters of both local and national significance.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Making a Difference</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;The strength of ACS&rsquo;s ideas and the scope of its nationwide network enable it to make a difference in legal and public policy debates and ensure that law is a force to improve the lives of all people. Recent examples of ACS initiatives and programs having an impact include an Issue Brief on the constitutionality of the individual mandate in the health care reform legislation, cited during the Senate floor debate and entered into the Congressional Record; Senator Al Franken&rsquo;s 2010 ACS National Convention speech in which he stated that &ldquo;Originalism isn&rsquo;t a pillar of our constitutional history; it&rsquo;s a talking point;&rdquo; and a concerted effort by ACS members to promote up-or-down votes on judicial nominations by engaging key decision makers.</p>',\n",

As a student organization, we hope to support and reach out to organizations that are helping the cause. We aim to raise awareness and educate the public about sex slavery, forced labor, child soldiering, and other types of human trafficking both internationally and domestically. We aim to empower others to take action to fight modern day slavery by reaching out to people from all walks of life and providing an avenue for action. Through collaboration between students, non-profit organizations, community members, people of faith, business leaders, policy makers, health professionals, artists, musicians, athletes, etc. we can take a momentous step towards the eradication of modern day slavery. Our goals do not only include raising awareness and educating others about the issue, but to also take action by working to change human trafficking legislation by starting in the state of California and by working with those who are currently employed in the prevention of human trafficking.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>(<strong>As of 2015-16 Anti-Trafficking Coalition at Berkeley</strong> represents the communities formerly known as International Justice Mission UC Berkeley Chapter, Student Abolitionist Movement and Stop the Traffick.)</p>',\n",

On this campus&mdash;where 42% of students&nbsp;identified as Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) in 2008&mdash;there was not a single academic course devoted to the study of health in AAPI communities. The AAPI Health Research Group (AAPIHRG) was formed in 2008 to fill this void. The purpose of this&nbsp;group is to share our journey and findings in AAPI community health with other students and community professionals who may wish to join us or contribute to the work.</p>\\r\\n<p>Although the aggregate data for our community paints a picture of a healthy population, we know that good health is not enjoyed by all. Our community is not homogeneous. The diversity of the many ethnic groups that make up the AAPI community presents challenges in obtaining accurate data. Students who come from these diverse backgrounds can be an important conduit in raising our awareness of health problems that exist in these communities. This can foster a deeper understanding of health in the broader AAPI community.</p>\\r\\n<p>Besides the 4-unit Spring course (ASAMST 190 - \"Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Community Health: Foundational Theories &amp; Contemporary Issues\"), we are inviting you to take part in our next steps as we develop&nbsp;as a student organization.

ACS works for positive change by shaping debate on vitally important legal and constitutional issues through development and promotion of high-impact ideas to opinion leaders and the media; by building networks of lawyers, law students, judges and policymakers dedicated to those ideas; and by countering the activist conservative legal movement that has sought to erode our enduring constitutional values. By bringing together powerful, relevant ideas and passionate, talented people, ACS makes a difference in the constitutional, legal and public policy debates that shape our democracy.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Shaping Debate</strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>The American Constitution Society brings together many of the country&rsquo;s best legal minds to articulate a progressive vision of our Constitution and laws. Through its public programs (over 1,100 debates, conferences and press briefings across America each year), publications, and active on-line presence, ACS generates &ldquo;intellectual capital&rdquo; for ready use by progressive allies and shapes debates on key legal and public policy issues.</p>\\r\\n<p>The American Constitution Society is also debunking conservative buzzwords such as &ldquo;originalism&rdquo; and &ldquo;strict construction&rdquo; that use neutral-sounding language but all too often lead to conservative policy outcomes. Using both traditional and new media to communicate with policymakers, judges, lawyers and the public at large, ACS presents a compelling vision of core constitutional values such as genuine equality, liberty, justice and the rule of law.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Building Networks</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;One of the American Constitution Society&rsquo;s principal missions is nurturing the next generation of progressive lawyers, judges, policy experts, legislators and academics.</p>\\r\\n<p>The engine that drives the organization&rsquo;s work is its rapidly growing nationwide network: nearly 200 student chapters in law schools in 47 states, 34 lawyer chapters in large and small cities in every part of the country, and over 16,000 paying members and thousands of other supporters. ACS chapters offer platforms for debate and discussion about both enduring principles and the issues of the day, as well as provide opportunities for networking, mentoring and organizing around matters of both local and national significance.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Making a Difference</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;The strength of ACS&rsquo;s ideas and the scope of its nationwide network enable it to make a difference in legal and public policy debates and ensure that law is a force to improve the lives of all people. Recent examples of ACS initiatives and programs having an impact include an Issue Brief on the constitutionality of the individual mandate in the health care reform legislation, cited during the Senate floor debate and entered into the Congressional Record; Senator Al Franken&rsquo;s 2010 ACS National Convention speech in which he stated that &ldquo;Originalism isn&rsquo;t a pillar of our constitutional history; it&rsquo;s a talking point;&rdquo; and a concerted effort by ACS members to promote up-or-down votes on judicial nominations by engaging key decision makers.</p>',\n",

On this campus&mdash;where 42% of students&nbsp;identified as Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) in 2008&mdash;there was not a single academic course devoted to the study of health in AAPI communities. The AAPI Health Research Group (AAPIHRG) was formed in 2008 to fill this void. The purpose of this&nbsp;group is to share our journey and findings in AAPI community health with other students and community professionals who may wish to join us or contribute to the work.</p>\\r\\n<p>Although the aggregate data for our community paints a picture of a healthy population, we know that good health is not enjoyed by all. Our community is not homogeneous. The diversity of the many ethnic groups that make up the AAPI community presents challenges in obtaining accurate data. Students who come from these diverse backgrounds can be an important conduit in raising our awareness of health problems that exist in these communities. This can foster a deeper understanding of health in the broader AAPI community.</p>\\r\\n<p>Besides the 4-unit Spring course (ASAMST 190 - \"Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Community Health: Foundational Theories &amp; Contemporary Issues\"), we are inviting you to take part in our next steps as we develop&nbsp;as a student organization. We are open <strong>to all students</strong> interested in community health and specifically the AAPI community. We hope that through&nbsp;this organization, we foster in students a desire to serve the community as well as provide opportunities for leadership development and networking.</p>\\r\\n<p>We invite your participation in AAPIHRG as a student or as a health professional sharing the following vision and mission:</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>VISION</strong></p>\\r\\n<p>A healthy community can only exist within a healthy society. We strive to improve the health of the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities through research and service within the community and through social activism in society.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>MISSION</strong></p>\\r\\n<p>The AAPI Health Research Group was formed in the spring of 2008. The purpose is to encourage students to engage in AAPI community health in the following five areas:</p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n<li>diversity of the AAPI communities</li>\\r\\n<li>historical perspective</li>\\r\\n<li>epidemiological perspective</li>\\r\\n<li>medical perspective</li>\\r\\n<li>social change</li>\\r\\n</ol>',\n",

ACS works for positive change by shaping debate on vitally important legal and constitutional issues through development and promotion of high-impact ideas to opinion leaders and the media; by building networks of lawyers, law students, judges and policymakers dedicated to those ideas; and by countering the activist conservative legal movement that has sought to erode our enduring constitutional values. By bringing together powerful, relevant ideas and passionate, talented people, ACS makes a difference in the constitutional, legal and public policy debates that shape our democracy.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Shaping Debate</strong><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>The American Constitution Society brings together many of the country&rsquo;s best legal minds to articulate a progressive vision of our Constitution and laws. Through its public programs (over 1,100 debates, conferences and press briefings across America each year), publications, and active on-line presence, ACS generates &ldquo;intellectual capital&rdquo; for ready use by progressive allies and shapes debates on key legal and public policy issues.</p>\\r\\n<p>The American Constitution Society is also debunking conservative buzzwords such as &ldquo;originalism&rdquo; and &ldquo;strict construction&rdquo; that use neutral-sounding language but all too often lead to conservative policy outcomes. Using both traditional and new media to communicate with policymakers, judges, lawyers and the public at large, ACS presents a compelling vision of core constitutional values such as genuine equality, liberty, justice and the rule of law.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Building Networks</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;One of the American Constitution Society&rsquo;s principal missions is nurturing the next generation of progressive lawyers, judges, policy experts, legislators and academics.</p>\\r\\n<p>The engine that drives the organization&rsquo;s work is its rapidly growing nationwide network: nearly 200 student chapters in law schools in 47 states, 34 lawyer chapters in large and small cities in every part of the country, and over 16,000 paying members and thousands of other supporters. ACS chapters offer platforms for debate and discussion about both enduring principles and the issues of the day, as well as provide opportunities for networking, mentoring and organizing around matters of both local and national significance.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Making a Difference</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;The strength of ACS&rsquo;s ideas and the scope of its nationwide network enable it to make a difference in legal and public policy debates and ensure that law is a force to improve the lives of all people. Recent examples of ACS initiatives and programs having an impact include an Issue Brief on the constitutionality of the individual mandate in the health care reform legislation, cited during the Senate floor debate and entered into the Congressional Record; Senator Al Franken&rsquo;s 2010 ACS National Convention speech in which he stated that &ldquo;Originalism isn&rsquo;t a pillar of our constitutional history; it&rsquo;s a talking point;&rdquo; and a concerted effort by ACS members to promote up-or-down votes on judicial nominations by engaging key decision makers.</p>',\n",

On this campus&mdash;where 42% of students&nbsp;identified as Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) in 2008&mdash;there was not a single academic course devoted to the study of health in AAPI communities. The AAPI Health Research Group (AAPIHRG) was formed in 2008 to fill this void. The purpose of this&nbsp;group is to share our journey and findings in AAPI community health with other students and community professionals who may wish to join us or contribute to the work.</p>\\r\\n<p>Although the aggregate data for our community paints a picture of a healthy population, we know that good health is not enjoyed by all. Our community is not homogeneous. The diversity of the many ethnic groups that make up the AAPI community presents challenges in obtaining accurate data. Students who come from these diverse backgrounds can be an important conduit in raising our awareness of health problems that exist in these communities. This can foster a deeper understanding of health in the broader AAPI community.</p>\\r\\n<p>Besides the 4-unit Spring course (ASAMST 190 - \"Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Community Health: Foundational Theories &amp; Contemporary Issues\"), we are inviting you to take part in our next steps as we develop&nbsp;as a student organization.

Because our department covers many different periods and regions, ranging from the ancient to the contemporary and from the Fertile Crescent to the Maghreb and beyond, it is easy for graduate students to become confined to their own niches. Thus, AGNES aims to promote a better integrated department, both socially and intellectually. AGNES will work to support departmental graduate social life, to create meeting places and academic opportunities for its members, and to further scholarly activities that nurture interdisciplinary dialogue between the different fields encompassed within the department.</p>',\n",

By the end, students will feel strong in their photographic abilities, be able to critique their own work, and see the world through an artistic eye, so they can further grow as a photographer.&nbsp;It is intended to be for beginners with little to no knowledge of how to use a dSLR or other camera with manual capabilities.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<p>Throughout the year, Innovative Design hosts a variety of events, from our annual designathon CMYK: Come Make Your MarK, speaker and workshop series RGB: Reach / Grow / Build, and an educational weekend series of creative workshops HEX: Hone and EXplore.

The team also spends time outside of meetings through our STeam Socials and community service days a few times per semester.</p>\\r\\n<p>Interested? Here are some of our current projects:</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Ethical eats</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, one of our latest projects, centers around giving students access to sustainable restaurants. Our website grants sustainability ratings to local Berkeley eateries. Our team also performed paid research with a graduate student documenting single-use plastic surrounding restaurants.

In the Spring of 2021, we will be teaching a course on reducing waste at home and at school through the platform. We firmly believe that change can be spurred from any age and it is vital to inform our future generations of our current environmental conditions. This team aims to inspire and educate kids to take action and live sustainably. </span></p>\\r\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Fall 2020, we organized a <strong>panel</strong> on the intersection between sustainability and racial justice, with activists, industry leaders, and academics attending to speak on the importance of intersectionality in their work. In Fall 2021, we will be hosting a<strong> workshop</strong> on communicating climate science to relatives, friends, and others close to you, emphasizing the importance of education and outreach in the fight for a sustainable future. Stay tuned for specific dates!</span></p>\\r\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, STeam organizes </span><strong>Sunstock</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a solar-powered music festival held on campus annually. STeam works hard year-round to prepare a venue, local lineup, sponsors, merchandise, and cuisine. Sunstock aims to unite students through music in an environmentally conscious way that brings light to improvements the music industry can make to be more sustainable. Our wide range of project niches displays how sustainability can be brought into all aspects of life and even combined with personal passions!</span></p>\\r\\n<p>We are always open to new ideas.&nbsp; The next project we work on could be yours!

It is important to stress the importance of the students' role in local issues, COA, and AOA in order to improve participation in legislative activities through their school years and post-graduation. The Bay Area Optometric Council Mentorship Program at Berkeley seeks to involve students in local community events, legislative days, and general membership meeting business talks.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>(3) Career Guidance:</strong></p>\\r\\n<p>The program&rsquo;s mentors come from a wide variety of backgrounds and have varying modes of practice and specialties. Students will gain career guidance by shadowing their mentors and learning about how they have achieved success. Students are encouraged to talk to all mentors in the program, not just their own, to be exposed to a larger variety career options.

Usually, races are 200, 500 or 2000 meters in length. Dragon boating is traditionally observed during the Chinese Duan Wu festival. However, it is now a much more common year-round activity and is one of the fastest-growing sports throughout the world.</p>\\r\\n<p>We are not recruiting Fall 2020 due to Covid, but will still have engagement videos and events for people interested in Cal DB and especially those interested in trying out Spring 2021.

As one of the fastest-growing Rotary programs, Rotaract on the international scale includes more than 8,000 Rotaract clubs in some 155 countries.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px 0px;\">Each individual Rotaract club is sponsored by a local Rotary club, and is generally either university- or community-based. Each chapter has its own unique personality, sometimes with special emphases and focuses dependent upon the array of members and their particular interests. Like Rotary, Rotaract clubs meet on a regular basis, and are nonpolitical, nonreligious and open to anyone interested.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px 0px;\">Rotaractors address many of global and local issues pertinent to today&rsquo;s society, developing projects that promote service, build friendship and provide a forum for cultural exchange.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px 0px;\">&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<h5 style=\"font: normal normal normal 1.9em/normal Georgia,\\'Times New Roman\\'; color: #3c78a7; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">Why Join Rotaract?</h5>\\r\\n<ul style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 15px 0px;\">\\r\\n<li style=\"list-style-type: square; list-style-position: initial; padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 0px 30px;\"><strong style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">Service opportunities:</strong>&nbsp;The main focus of Rotaract is humanitarian service on all fronts&ndash;locally, nationally and internationally.

Remembering the heritage and the history left by CalSMV alumni, the Team today seeks to expand the original mission of efficiency towards a larger, real-world scope &mdash; quite literally.</p>\\r\\n<p>Starting in 2016, CalSMV began pursuing an ultra-efficient vehicle driven by a pure battery-electric drivetrain&nbsp;<em>(a first for the team)</em>&nbsp;on top of a large street legal carbon-monocoque.</p>\\r\\n<p>The vehicle, aptly named&nbsp;<em>Lux</em>, features custom motor controller, and a design built completely in-house with our very own CNC router. To match real world expectations,&nbsp;<em>Lux</em>&nbsp;will feature safety designs such as dual-crumple zones and double-wishbone&nbsp;suspension systems. No detail is left behind, not even windshield wipers. The CalSMV Team is driven by curiosity and by enthusiasm; there are no bounds!</p>\\r\\n<p>The aim behind such a large ambition resides in our team&rsquo;s shared desire to push beyond the bounds of competition in order to experience what it is like to build a vehicle for the real world. The challenges that reside with such a goal offer opportunities for stimulating innovations, new industry collaborations, and immersive hands-on experiences. And for the Team, beyond engineering and design, our number one goal is to bring together the CalSMV Family and develop firsthand skills to pass on as wonderful, insightful experiences.</p>\\r\\n<p>&ndash;<strong>&nbsp;cal super mileage vehicle Team</strong></p>',\n",

Parker Duncan, the first Medical Student Fellow, was extremely involved in the development of the student leaders during these years.</p>\\r\\n<p>In 2009, involved campus student leaders, along with the statewide Lobby Day team, held their first student leadership meeting to brainstorm ways to structure the organization for the future. There was a general consensus that additional organization at the state level could be a useful tool for CaHPSA. The mission statement was developed from a rougher draft of the previous year. The core functions of the organization were agreed upon to be \"Educate &ndash; Advocate &ndash; Grow\" and statewide positions were developed from these core functions.</p>\\r\\n<p>CaHPSA at Berkeley too aligns with the belief \"health justice for all\" and endeavors to carrying the following goals:</p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Support efforts to improve quality of and access to health care in California</li>\\r\\n<li>Provide opportunities for students to develop health advocacy and communication skills</li>\\r\\n<li>Educate and train future health and medical professionals to become effective health advocates</li>\\r\\n<li>Engender a sense of social responsibility among students</li>\\r\\n<li>Advocate for a single-payer health system</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>We offer programs such as Project White Coat to certify students in helping more people enroll in health insurance and prepare for the annual Lobby Day which occurs in Sacramento.

The Center&rsquo;s first big milestone came when the Chancellor announced Berkeley would create a confidential advocate position, a crucial resource for survivors seeking services, as well as for those seeking to understand or pursue a university disciplinary process.</p>\\r\\n<p>Later in 2014, the first Bear Pact program launched, educating all incoming first-year and transfer undergraduate students about sexual violence prevention, with content designed and delivered by the University Health Services Health Promotion team. Following this, in the fall, the first advocate &ndash; who would go on to become the Center&rsquo;s first director &ndash; was hired: Mari Knuth-Bouracee.</p>\\r\\n<p>The Center saw an immediate and overwhelming demand for services, which led to the ASUC and GA passing the Wellness Initiative Fee Referendum &ndash; a commitment of student fees funding several initiatives, including a new advocate position for the Center. This Referendum solidified the University&rsquo;s commitment to expanding the Center&rsquo;s resources for all who need them, and helped lead to rapid growth: two advocates were hired, sexual violence prevention education was included for the first time in graduate student education, and an Assistant Director for Prevention joined the Center&rsquo;s team. With the rapid expansion and demand for services, the Center quickly grew out of its one-room office and into a new space that included two counseling rooms for client meetings, crucial for confidentiality, in early 2016.</p>\\r\\n<p>In mid-2016, the Center added an Assistant Director for Survivor Support, a Program Analyst, and two Prevention Program Managers. The need for the Center was clear &ndash; and in July, the US Office on Women&rsquo;s Health awarded the University a grant, with the Center as the lead department, to continue to expand this work.</p>\\r\\n<p>The Center then launched a peer education program, which began with the hiring of 11 peer educators, as well as a Care Line, the 24/7 crisis line for the University. Continuing its focus on graduate student sexual violence prevention, the Center hired its first Program Manager for Graduate Prevention. The Center also launched The Well, a Black healing space co-led by a Center advocate.</p>\\r\\n<p>Since its launch, the Center has continued to deepen its focus on both survivor support and prevention. By late 2017, videos created by the Center highlighting these practices had been shown to over 15,000 students, faculty and staff (and continue to be shown each year); the Center launched Yoga As Healing groups; and the Center received further recognition when the Office on Violence Against Women awarded the University a grant, with the Center as the lead department. Another major milestone was successfully advocating for funding for a Prevention Manager for Staff and Faculty Programs; a role that was filled in 2018. Today, the Center continues to expand in both its staff capacity and in the services it provides, further solidifying its place as a key resource for the University.<br /><br />Contact us today for support!</p>\\r\\n</div>',\n",

CIB operates as a general partnership investment club actively managed by managing general partners Chad Hamner, Mae Zheng, Harsh Ainapure, and Nathan Richards.</p>\\r\\n<p>Our investment philosophy is founded on the belief that capital preservation is more important than capital gains and in the long run a dynamic asset allocation and reactivity to market inefficiencies can generate above market returns. Further, we believe that as students, we have a unique perspective and differentiated views on markets, economies, and current events which provide rare opportunities for investors. Finally, we believe that as stewards of capital we have a deep responsibility to consider all stakeholders affected by our decisions, including our investors, employees of publicly traded companies, our communities, disadvantaged groups, the environment, and more. Only through active management and dedicated equity research can these responsibilities be fully materialized in investing.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p>Our team leverages the unique skill-sets of our members and their varied academic and vocational backgrounds to deliver these returns to our partners. CIB draws on the combined experience of our members as employees of investment banks, hedge funds, asset managers, federal regulatory agencies, technology companies, legal firms, and start-ups notably including Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Lazard, BlackRock, Centerview Partners, IMC, JMP Securities, the Federal Reserve, Dodge and Cox, Point72, and Google.</p>\\r\\n<p>Our culture is data and performance driven; we combine the financial acumen of our veteran members with the entrepreneurial philosophy of our school to create dynamism within existing investment structures. This creativity and unique synthesis of information is the cornerstone of CIB&rsquo;s idea generation.</p>\\r\\n<p>Our portfolio utilizes hedging strategies and a &ldquo;risk-management first&rdquo; approach to realize consistent returns that outperform the market. Trades are made through quantitative evaluation of a risk-reward profile and the ever-changing market environment.</p>\\r\\n<p>Capital Investments at Berkeley&rsquo;s long term goals include achieving capital preservation and gains regardless of market conditions, maintaining our loyal investor base, continuing to leverage our extensive alumni network, and providing students interested in finance and investment management real world opportunities to create value and preparation for careers.</p>',\n",

Engineering, the application of scientific principles to the practical needs of society, is assuming a constantly increasing responsibility for the physical well-being of all people, and thus calling for competence of the highest order. This responsibility can be discharged only by a professional group whose members are possessed of a good basic technical ability, intelligence, moral integrity, and effective social poise in their relationship with the larger community of which they are part.

On December 1, 1975, Lambda Theta Phi was founded on the campu<span class=\"x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_x_text_exposed_show\">s of Kean College in Union, New Jersey.<br /><br />The ideals of this brotherhood are the following: Academic Excellence; Brotherhood; Leadership; Latino Unity; Service. On a daily basis, our brothers live up to these ideals, as set forth by fourteen young Latino men decades ago.&nbsp;<br /><br />Since our founding, Lambda Theta Phi has established chapters in every region of the country at both the undergraduate and professional levels. Our brotherhood continues to provide the necessary skills and resources for the advancement and empowerment of our people and for the betterment of this nation.&nbsp;<br /><br />The University of California, Berkeley was home to the newest chapter of Lambda Theta Phi, Latin Fraternity, Inc. in the Spring semester of 2004. Ten undergraduate students came together with the idea of introducing a positive image of a Latino fraternity to the UC Berkeley campus. They wanted to embrace and take part in the unity, brotherhood, pride and respect for all cultures that Lambda Theta Phi offered.<br /><br />On May 9, 2004, Luis Sanchez, Renato Manay, Renzo Manay, Arquimides Pacheco, and Rafael Hernandez created a historical landmark and established the first Latino Greek Letter Fraternity officially recognized by the National Interfraternal Council (NIC) on the UC Berkeley campus.<br /><br />Now, since its establishment and through its further development and growth, Lambda Theta Phi in UC Berkeley has continued to carry through its ideals of a service/social fraternity by giving back to the community while engaging in social activities that would allow further bondages among our members and with other organizations. Such include our participation in the Annual AIDS Walk, our service in low-income Oakland Elementary schools, and advocacy of immigrant rights to day laborers within the county of Alameda. Apart from these community service events, this chapter has sought to create strong ties and mutual respect with other Latin and non-Latin organizations through social activities and collaborative efforts.<br /><br />Lastly, the main goal of Lambda Theta Phi in UC Berkeley is to pursue the educational success of our fraternity brothers. At the national level, from New Jersey to California, many go on to become doctors, lawyers, engineers, among other professionals.</span></p>',\n",

As a council we shall uphold our commitment to service, scholarship and the values of sisterhood and brotherhood.</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Member Organizations: 9 Sororities, 6 Fraternities</strong></span></span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Delta Xi Phi Multicultural Sorority</strong></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*Multicultural Interest Sorority</p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;<strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Gamma Zeta Alpha Fraternity, Inc.</span></strong></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">* Latino Interest Fraternity</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Gamma Rho Lambda National Sorority</span></strong></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">* LGBTQ &amp; Ally Interest Sorority</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Lambda Phi Epsilon Fraternity</span></strong></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">* Asian American Interest Fraternity</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Lambda Theta Alpha Latin Sorority, Inc.</span></strong></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">* Latina Interest Sorority</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Lambda Theta Nu Sorority, Inc.</span></strong></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">* Latina Interest Sorority</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Lambda Theta Phi Latin Fraternity, Inc.</span></strong></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">* Latino Interest Fraternity</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">La Unidad Latina, Lambda Upsilon Lambda Fraternity, Inc.</span></strong></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">* Latino Interest Fraternity</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Omega Phi Beta Sorority, Inc.</strong></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">* Latina Interest Sorority</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Sigma Epsilon Omega</span></strong></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">* Gay and Queer fraternity</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Sigma Omicron Pi Sorority, Inc.</span></strong></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">* Asian American Interest Sorority</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Sigma Pi Alpha Sorority, Inc.</span></strong></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">* Chicana / Latina Interest Sorority</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Sigma Phi Omega Sorority, Inc.</span></strong></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">* Asian American Interest Sorority</span></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Phi Sigma Rho National Sorority</strong></p>\\r\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">*Engineering &amp; Engineering Technology Sorority</p>\\r\\n<p>&nbsp;</p>',\n",

Using experiential learning and Instagrammable exhibits, we encourage easy, everyday solutions to overcome climate change and its harmful impacts globally. Although climate change can be an overwhelming and fearful topic, our efforts aim to increase one&rsquo;s optimism and likelihood to tackle environmental issues by promoting sustainability as a positive, social norm. Our curatorial exhibits and the lasting impact we make from our audience emphasizes our belief that all efforts should be encouraged and celebrated. By supporting our exhibits with statistics and other evidential data, we further motivate the idea that sustainability and environmental mitigation should and can be achieved, one effort at a time.

       "  'desc': '<p>The Music Connection (TMC), in collaboration with the Berkeley Unified School District and Oakland Unified School District, aims to provide free, supplemental music tutoring for young musicians through in-class tutoring and private lessons. By doing so, TMC provides young students with a strong foundation in music, which will help them to develop cooperation, self-confidence, and an appreciation for music.</p>\\r\\n<p>We are an organization that currently has about 70 tutors and continues to grow through our success within UC Berkeley and our surrounding communities. We provide free music lessons to students in the Berkeley community in many different forms. Our tutors are UC Berkeley students from a variety of academic backgrounds, but all with extensive musical experience. TMC is a way for students at Berkeley to become involved in the surrounding community by connecting with their students and sharing the expressive and creative gift that is music.&nbsp;Tutors are given the opportunity to connect with the community, practice music, and hone valuable teaching skills.&nbsp;Our programs include In-Class Tutoring and Private Tutoring. We emphasize tutoring for low-income students who may not have ready access to music lessons.</p>\\r\\n<p>In addition to our two main tutoring programs, we also host free events for the local Berkeley community. Our main events outside of our end-of-semester TMC Recital include College Music Days, Spring Music Festival, and Instrument Petting Zoo. For our College Music Days, we invite BUSD/OUSD students to visit&nbsp;a rehearsal of the UC Berkeley Symphony Orchestra or UC Berkeley Wind Ensemble and play along. Every April, we host a Spring Music Festival, during which students can perform a piece for UC Berkeley Music Department faculty and receive feedback. On Cal Day, we lead an Instrument Petting Zoo, during which children may try out different instruments.</p>\\r\\n<p><strong>Applications will be released in September!</strong></p>',\n",
